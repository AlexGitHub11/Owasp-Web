A software security game

### Overview
WASP Web is a deliberately vulnerable web application intended to test user's software security skills. Users can complete all 10 levels by exploiting a different OWASP Top 10 
vulnerability at each level. Complete all 10 levels to get the WASP Web certificate.

This project is inspired by the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and aims to provide practical examples of common web security vulnerabilities and how to exploit them for educational purposes only. This project is not officially affiliated with OWASP.
